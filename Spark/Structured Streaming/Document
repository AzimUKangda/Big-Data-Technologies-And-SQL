Trigger Time & Event Time 

-----> Processing in Structured Streaming take place based on Trigger time not on Event Time(unless we use watermarking).

How Structured Streaming Works.

-----> Structured Streaming Read Data From Source Process Incrementally, updates results & Discards source. Only minimal intermediate state 
maintained.

When Writting to sink. entire table is not materialized. what is written out depends on the mode.

Develper can configure output mode.

Structured streming supports Three modes. which will determines what result table rows get sent to storage.

1) Update Mode -- Send All rows which are updated since last trigger. Even Previous rows/results will get updated in case of aggregations.
2) Append Mode -- Only new rows will get appened. Previous result rows can't change.
3) complete Mode -- Complete table will get written in each trigger. At output side, size of data will be very huge.storage connector must
decide how to use all data.
