1-core = 1-task = 1-partition

while writting file, if you want to decrease number of file creation or you want to increase file size of write, use colease insted of 
repartition.

in data bricks please use DB/IO Caching or delta caching. it's 5 to 6 times faster than memory cache.

difference between persisit and brodacast 

--> in persisit

assume i have df of size 12gb, 6 partitions and 3 executers.

2 partitions will be copied to each executes. 4gb of ram in each execture will be occupied.

in broadcat

each execute will get 2 partition. than data of each partition will be copied to driver using collect and hashmap will be created and
copy of it will be send to each executer.

that means each executer will have complete set of data.

use <=> in condition statement, becuse it's null safe, means it will not compare nulls if it finds it will remove those and will save time.

also use not exist insted of not in 

Range join optimization.

drop duplicates before group by, join 

aprroxcountdistinct.
