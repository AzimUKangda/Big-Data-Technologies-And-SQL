Main Issue: too few partitions
 - Less concurrency
 - More susceptible to data skew.
 - Increased memory pressure for groupby, sortByKey, reduceByKey etc..

Secondary Issue: Too many partitions.

To avoid both issue will need reasonable number of the partitions.
 - commonly between 100 and 10,000 partitions.
 - Lower bound: At least 2 * number of cores in cluster
 - upper bound: Ensure each taks takes at least 100ms
