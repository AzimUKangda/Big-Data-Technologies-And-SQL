How to Return Option Value From Function.
--> Option(value).filter(_.nonEmpty)

How to Check Value Returned As Option or check value of Option Type
--> There are three ways
1) Using Pattern Matching
2) Using getOrElse
3) Using map

How to Define Function with implicit parameter
---> def function(val1: Int)(implicit val2:Double) 

How to Call Function with implicit parameter
---> declare implicit variable in the scope wherever function will be called. or pass value with addition bracket like declaration of 
function.

Referential Transparency?
---> A function is said to be referentially transparent if we can replace it with a corresponding value without changing the program's
behaviour.

side effect --> Function should not modify any outside variable/input param.

why Pure Function?

1) Encourage safe ways of programming.
2) simple and easy to re-use.
3) composable or modular. (andThenThis) -- function composition.
4) Easy to test.
5) Memoizable (you can cache the function)
6) Pure Function can be lazy.

What is First class Function?
--> If you can treat a function as a value, it is a first class function. you can pass function as arg also you can return function from 
other function.

by default all function in scala are first class function.
